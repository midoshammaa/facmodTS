Description: Linear factor model fitting for asset returns (three major types-
    time series, fundamental and statistical factor models); related risk
    (volatility, VaR and ES) and performance attribution (factor-contributed vs
    idiosyncratic returns); tabular displays of risk and performance reports;
    factor model Monte Carlo.
